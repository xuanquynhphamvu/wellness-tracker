Task Summary: Integrate with Edit Route
Summary: Added a complex integration test to `admin.quizzes.$id.edit.test.tsx` to verify that the edit route's `action` correctly processes and saves quizzes with multiple questions and score ranges. Confirmed that the route already correctly utilizes the new `QuestionList` component and backend persistence logic.
Files:
- app/routes/admin.quizzes.$id.edit.tsx (Verified)
- app/routes/admin.quizzes.$id.edit.test.tsx
Why: Ensures that the dynamic quiz builder can reliably handle sophisticated data structures during the editing process.
