# Product Guidelines - Wellness Tracker

## Tone and Voice
- **Professional and Empathetic:** The application communicates in a balanced, trustworthy, and supportive manner. It acknowledges the sensitivity of wellness data while maintaining a reliable and professional standard.

## Visual Identity
- **Minimalist and Clean:** Interfaces prioritize whitespace and clarity to reduce cognitive load, ensuring that users can focus on their assessments without distraction.
- **Calming Color Palette:** The design utilizes soft blues, greens, and neutral tones to evoke a sense of tranquility and safety, aligned with the mental health focus of the app.

## User Experience & Interaction

- **Mobile-First Accessibility:** Interactions are optimized for touch and smaller screens first, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.

## Documentation & Code Style
- **Educational and Detailed:** Code and documentation are written with a "learning first" mindset. Comments focus on explaining the *why* behind architectural decisions and the *how* of complex patterns, mirroring the project's goal as a learning resource.
