# Wellness Tracker - Learning Phases

This folder contains detailed documentation from learning Phases 1-3 of the React Router Framework.

## Phase Documents

- **[phase1_route_analysis.md](./phase1_route_analysis.md)** - Complete analysis of all 9 routes, data flow patterns, and architecture
- **[phase2_loader_deep_dive.md](./phase2_loader_deep_dive.md)** - Deep dive into loaders: simple, dynamic, and aggregated patterns
- **[phase3_action_deep_dive.md](./phase3_action_deep_dive.md)** - Deep dive into actions: create, update, delete, and multi-intent patterns

## What These Phases Covered

### Phase 1: Route Architecture Audit
- Analyzed all existing routes
- Documented route hierarchy and nesting
- Identified missing authentication features
- Mapped data flow patterns

### Phase 2: Loader Deep Dive
- Simple loaders (list data)
- Dynamic loaders (single item by ID)
- Aggregated loaders (complex queries)
- Server vs client execution
- Best practices and common pitfalls

### Phase 3: Action Deep Dive
- Create actions (insert new records)
- Update actions (modify existing records)
- Delete actions (remove records)
- Multi-intent actions (one action, multiple operations)
- FormData handling and validation

## Next Phases

See [../implementation_plan.md](../implementation_plan.md) for the full roadmap.

**Current:** Phase 4 - Authentication Foundation
**Next:** Phase 5 - Route Protection & Authorization
